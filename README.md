# Simple remote

## Installation

On Windows the mouse cursor might disappear e.g. after the PC has awaken from sleep.
In this case you can disable cursor suppression by setting the registry value 

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
EnableCursorSuppression = 0
```

and restart the PC.
